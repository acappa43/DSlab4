 * Tower of Hanoi
 * This program plays the game of Tower of Hanoi with a number of disks
 * specified by the user (with a maximum determined by class constants).
 * The game solves itself recursively, showing the user each move along
 * the way.
 * The "simple" version uses stacks, but this version uses lists to
 * simulate stacks, because this version prints a visual representation
 * of the stacks after each move.  Using stacks would cause all stacks
 * to be emptied when printing the towers after each move.  Although
 * they could be stored in temporary stacks as they're printed, and
 * then re-populated, lists are much more efficient since we never
 * actually remove anything while printing.
